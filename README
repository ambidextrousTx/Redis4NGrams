Showing how to use Redis and python-redis for uploading and fast access of Google Web1T n-gram data.

Redis is known for blazing speed. Use the script to upload your n-gram data to the Redis store (small changes here and there should make it all work for you). Use the following pipeline:

[1] Install Redis
[2] Run the Redis server
[3] Install python-redis
[4] Type in the Python script, uncomment the 1gms part, and run it (it might run for a while, takes 20 minutes on an 8GB Core i5 machine to upload 13 million 1-grams) 
[5] Start Python REPL
[6] Use the following to query n-grams in constant time:

> import redis
> rs = redis.Redis('localhost') # Or wherever your server is running
> rs.zcard('en:1gms') # Get the cardinality, I'm using ordered sets here
> rs.zscore('en:1gms', 'hello') # Get the n-gram count for hello

Use 'en:2gms', 'en:3gms' etc for the other n-grams
